## D3 Data Exploration Tool

I chose a bar chart for this kind of data because I wanted to be able to show the different number of professors at Washington state universities. I chose to have the y axis be the number of professors fitting within the salary range for the year because I wanted to show more than just the percentage fitting in each salary category because you will also be able to get the number of professors at a school. By using a bar graph you are able to use position, size, and color encoding. The position encoding is done through the ordinal values on the x axis relating to the salary ranges and the position on the y axis pertaining to the number of people in that category. Size of the bars show the magnitude of for each category. Color is based on the school colors of the university that was picked.

There are two filters for the data. One filter lets you pick the university you want to be graphed with the default year value of 2011. The second filter lets you pick the year of salary data from 2011 to 2014. These filters let you go school by school to look at their salary data and then you can go between the years for the school to see any changes between the years. If I could go back and if I had more experience I would have made it so that you could pick two universities and compare them based on a certain year of salary data.
